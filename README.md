## 🚀 Setting Up My Arch ⚙️

This repository contains scripts that I use whenever I set up my Arch Linux system. My goal is to fully optimize the system for performance. To achieve this, I use custom repositories and packages, including those provided by ALHP and Cachyos.


## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

## 1. Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elysiumayo/Arch-setup.git
cd arch-linux-optimization
```
## 2. Run the Scripts (Optional)
If you want to run all the scripts provided in this repository, use the following commands:

```bash git clone https://github.com/elysiumayo/Arch-setup.git
git clone https://github.com/elysiumayo/Arch-setup.git
cd arch-linux-optimization
chmod +x master.sh
./master.sh
```
## 3. Important Notes

Keep in mind that I'm still working on master.sh to add more functionality.
I haven't fully tested the script yet, so proceed with caution.
You know the drill: use at your own risk! 😄
