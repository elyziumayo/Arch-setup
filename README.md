## ⚙ Setting Up My Arch

This repository contains scripts that I use whenever I set up my Arch Linux system. My goal is to fully optimize the system for performance. To achieve this, I use custom repositories and packages, including those provided by ALHP and Cachyos.


## 🚀 Getting Started 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elysiumayo/Arch-setup.git
cd arch-linux-optimization
chmod +x master.sh
./master.sh
```
## 📝  Important Notes

Keep in mind that I'm still working on master.sh to add more functionality.
I haven't fully tested the script yet, so proceed with caution.
You know the drill: use at your own risk! 😄
