## Cause of Death
Terminal illness. Replaced by a better script that doesn't require sacrificing your system to the Arch gods.

## Last Words
"sudo rm -rf /* ... just kidding!"

## Survived By
- Its successor (coming soon)
- One working backup
- Several traumatized test VMs

## Reincarnation
ðŸš€ Check out the successor: [New-Arch-Setup(Aetheros)](https://github.com/elysiumayo/Aetheros.git)

*In memory of all the systems that died during testing. Your sacrifice taught us what NOT to do.*
